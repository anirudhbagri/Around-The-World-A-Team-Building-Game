# Around-The-World-A-Team-Building-Game

Around the world is an outdoor team building game which can be played with any number of players.
All players then form teams, preferably with minimum 4 people.

# Objective

Each team needs to travel from their starting city — around the world — and back to their origin city. The first team to complete the tour by covering all the cities wins the game.

# Preparation

1. Use the program to generate placards. Depending on how many people are there. Usually 4 poles is enough for 20-25 people game.
2. Take a print out of these placard and places each one at its pole (hide it until the game begins).
3. Each team leader must have pen/pencil + paper or anything else that can be used to note down the cites
4. Envelopes for the host to share the starting city for each team 

# How to play the game

Once all the placards are in position and the players are ready, the host will  hand out the starting city to each team either inside an envelope or in such a manner that no other team can see. (Note that the starting city should preferably be different for each team)

Each placard has two columns, “Source” and “Destination”, the players start with their starting city, finds out where is the destination for that city and then tries to find the next destination for that city. In the mean, the leader is responsible for noting down the travel journal.  The players can use any way to communicate the route to their leader, except any electronic medium. No player should touch the placard.

The game ends when the team reaches its origin city.  The host then check for the correctness of the route and the first team to complete the tour by covering all the locations wins the game.
